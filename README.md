features:

1. add a material
2. replace a material
3. delete a material
4. clear list of materials

Why i want to make this add on? To make it easier to add, delete, replace, or apply the materials to multiple objects. 

Was specifically made to help me change the material and/or color to my vector lightbar bulbs for a NYPD cruiser model without me having to click on every object to apply changes manually.
